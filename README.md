# VeriDesigns

VeriDesigns is a collection of **digital design circuits written in Verilog HDL**. It includes examples ranging from simple logic gates to more advanced designs like counters, FSMs, and small processors. The repo is intended for students, hobbyists, and engineers who want to **learn, simulate, and synthesize hardware designs**.

### Features
- ✅ Combinational & sequential circuits  
- ✅ Arithmetic modules (adders, ALUs, multipliers)  
- ✅ Counters, shift registers, and FSMs  
- ✅ Example testbenches for simulation  
- ✅ Organized folder structure for easy navigation
